Usage
-----

.. dynamic: usage-begin

.. code:: text

    usage:
    cmake-format [-h]
                 [--dump-config {yaml,json,python} | -i | -o OUTFILE_PATH]
                 [-c CONFIG_FILE]
                 infilepath [infilepath ...]

    Parse cmake listfiles and format them nicely.

    Formatting is configurable by providing a configuration file. The configuration
    file can be in json, yaml, or python format. If no configuration file is
    specified on the command line, cmake-format will attempt to find a suitable
    configuration for each ``inputpath`` by checking recursively checking it's
    parent directory up to the root of the filesystem. It will return the first
    file it finds with a filename that matches '\.?cmake-format(.yaml|.json|.py)'.

    cmake-format can spit out the default configuration for you as starting point
    for customization. Run with `--dump-config [yaml|json|python]`.

    positional arguments:
      infilepaths

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
      -l {error,warning,info,debug}, --log-level {error,warning,info,debug}
      --dump-config [{yaml,json,python}]
                            If specified, print the default configuration to
                            stdout and exit
      --dump {lex,parse,layout,markup}
      -i, --in-place
      -o OUTFILE_PATH, --outfile-path OUTFILE_PATH
                            Where to write the formatted file. Default is stdout.
      -c CONFIG_FILES [CONFIG_FILES ...], --config-files CONFIG_FILES [CONFIG_FILES ...]
                            path to configuration file(s)

    Formatter Configuration:
      Override configfile options affecting general formatting

      --line-width LINE_WIDTH

                            groups (parg or kwarg groups), then force it to a
                            vertical layout.
      --max-pargs-hwrap MAX_PARGS_HWRAP
                            If a positinal argument group contains more than this

      --dangle-parens [DANGLE_PARENS]
                            If a statement is wrapped to more than one line, than
                            dangle the closing parenthesis on it's own line.
      --dangle-align {prefix,prefix-indent,child,off}
                            If the trailing parenthesis must be 'dangled' on it's
                            on line, then align it to this reference: `prefix`:
                            the start of the statement, `prefix-indent`: the start
                            of the statement, plus one indentation level, `child`:
                            align to the column of the arguments
      --min-prefix-chars MIN_PREFIX_CHARS
      --max-prefix-chars MAX_PREFIX_CHARS

                            parenthesis) is larger than the tab width by more than
                            this amount, then force reject un-nested layouts.
      --max-lines-hwrap MAX_LINES_HWRAP
                            If a candidate layout is wrapped horizontally but it
                            exceeds this many lines, then reject the layout.
      --line-ending {windows,unix,auto}
                            What style line endings to use in the output.
      --command-case {lower,upper,canonical,unchanged}
                            Format command names consistently as 'lower' or

                            sortable will be sorted lexicographicall
      --autosort [AUTOSORT]
                            If true, the parsers may infer whether or not an
                            argument list is sortable (without annotation).
      --hashruler-min-length HASHRULER_MIN_LENGTH
                            If a comment line starts with at least this many
                            consecutive hash characters, then don't lstrip() them
                            off. This allows for lazy hash rulers where the first
                            hash char is not separated by space

                            If comment markup is enabled, don't reflow the first
                            comment block in each listfile. Use this to preserve
                            formatting of your copyright/license statements.
      --literal-comment-pattern LITERAL_COMMENT_PATTERN
                            If comment markup is enabled, don't reflow any comment
                            block which matches this (regex) pattern. Default is
                            `None` (disabled).
      --fence-pattern FENCE_PATTERN
                            Regular expression to match preformat fences in
                            comments default=r'^\s*([`~]{3}[`~]*)(.*)$'

      --canonicalize-hashrulers [CANONICALIZE_HASHRULERS]
                            If true, then insert a space between the first hash
                            char and remaining hash chars in a hash ruler, and
                            normalize it's length to fill the column

    Misc Options:
      Override miscellaneous config options

      --emit-byteorder-mark [EMIT_BYTEORDER_MARK]
                            If true, emit the unicode byte-order mark (BOM) at the
                            start of the file
      --input-encoding INPUT_ENCODING
                            Specify the encoding of the input file. Defaults to
                            utf-8.
      --output-encoding OUTPUT_ENCODING
                            Specify the encoding of the output file. Defaults to
                            utf-8. Note that cmake only claims to support utf-8 so
                            be careful when using anything else

``cmake-format`` accepts configuration files in yaml, json, or python format.
An example configuration file is given here. Additional flags and additional

.. dynamic: configuration-end

You may specify a path to a configuration file with the ``--config-file``
command line option. Otherwise, ``cmake-format`` will search the ancestry
of each ``infilepath`` looking for a configuration file to use. If no
configuration file is found it will use sensible defaults.

A automatically detected configuration files may have any name that matches
``\.?cmake-format(.yaml|.json|.py)``.

If you'd like to create a new configuration file, ``cmake-format`` can help
by dumping out the default configuration in your preferred format. You can run
``cmake-format --dump-config [yaml|json|python]`` to print the default
configuration ``stdout`` and use that as a starting point.

.. dynamic: features-begin

-------
Markup
-------

``cmake-format`` is for the exceptionally lazy. It will even format your
comments for you. It will reflow your comment text to within the configured
line width. It also understands a very limited markup format for a couple of
common bits.

**rulers**: A ruler is a line which starts with and ends with three or more
non-alphanum or space characters::

    # ---- This is a Ruler ----
    # cmake-format will know to keep the ruler separated from the
    # paragraphs around it. So it wont try to reflow this text as
    # a single paragraph.
    # ---- This is also a Ruler ---


**list**: A list is started on the first encountered list item, which starts
with a bullet character (``*``) followed by a space followed by some text.
Subsequent lines will be included in the list item until the next list item
is encountered (the bullet must be at the same indentation level). The list
must be surrounded by a pair of empty lines. Nested lists will be formatted in
nested text::

    # here are some lists:
    #
    # * item 1
    # * item 2
    #
    #   * subitem 1
    #   * subitem 2
    #
    # * second list item 1
    # * second list item 2

**enumerations**: An enumeration is similar to a list but the bullet character
is some integers followed by a period. New enumeration items are detected as
long as either the first digit or the punctuation lines up in the same column
as the previous item. ``cmake-format`` will renumber your items and align their
labels for you::

    # This is an enumeration
    #
    #   1. item
    #   2. item
    #   3. item

**fences**: If you have any text which you do not want to be formatted you can
guard it with a pair of fences. Fences are three or more tilde characters::

    # ~~~
    # This comment is fenced
    #   and will not be formatted
    # ~~~

Note that comment fences guard reflow of *comment text*, and not cmake code.
If you wish to prevent formatting of cmake, code, see below. In addition to
fenced-literals, there are three other ways to preserve comment text from
markup and/or reflow processing:

* The ``--first-comment-is-literal`` configuration option will exactly preserve
  the first comment in the file. This is intended to preserve copyright or
  other formatted header comments.
* The ``--literal-comment-pattern`` configuration option allows for a more
  generic way to identify comments which should be preserved literally. This
  configuration takes a regular expression pattern.
* The ``--enable-markup`` configuration option globally enables comment markup
  processing. It defaults to true so set it to false if you wish to globally
  disable comment markup processing. Note that trailing whitespace is still
  chomped from comments.

--------------------------
Disable Formatting Locally
--------------------------

You can locally disable and enable code formatting by using the special
comments ``# cmake-format: off`` and ``# cmake-format: on``.

-------------------
Sort Argument Lists
-------------------

Starting with version `0.5.0`, ``cmake-format`` can sort your argument lists
for you. If the configuration includes ``autosort=True`` (the default), it
will replace::

    add_library(foobar STATIC EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
                sourcefile_06.cc
                sourcefile_03.cc
                sourcefile_02.cc
                sourcefile_04.cc
                sourcefile_07.cc
                sourcefile_01.cc
                sourcefile_05.cc)

with::

    add_library(foobar STATIC EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
                sourcefile_01.cc
                sourcefile_02.cc
                sourcefile_03.cc
                sourcefile_04.cc
                sourcefile_05.cc
                sourcefile_06.cc
                sourcefile_07.cc)

This is implemented for any argument lists which the parser knows are
inherently sortable. This includes the following cmake commands:

* ``add_library``
* ``add_executable``

For most other cmake commands, you can use an annotation comment to hint to
``cmake-format`` that the argument list is sortable. For instance::

    set(SOURCES
        # cmake-format: sortable
        bar.cc
        baz.cc
        foo.cc)

Annotations can be given in a line-comment or a bracket comment. There is a
long-form and a short-form for each. The acceptable formats are:

+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+
| Line Comment    | long  | ``# cmake-format: <tag>``    |
+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+
| Line Comment    | short | ``# cmf: <tag>``             |
+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+
| Bracket Comment | long  | ``#[[cmake-format: <tag>]]`` |
+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+
| Bracket Comment | short | ``#[[cmf: <tag>]]``          |
+-----------------+-------+------------------------------+

In order to annotate a positional argument list as sortable, the acceptable
tags are: ``sortable`` or ``sort``. For the commands listed above where
the positional argument lists are inherently sortable, you can locally disable
sorting by annotating them with ``unsortable`` or ``unsort``. For example::

    add_library(foobar STATIC
                # cmake-format: unsort
                sourcefile_03.cc
                sourcefile_01.cc
                sourcefile_02.cc)

Note that this is only needed if your configuration has enabled ``autosort``,
and you can globally disable sorting by making setting this configuration to
``False``.


---------------
Custom Commands
---------------

Due to the fact that cmake is a macro language, `cmake-format` is, by
necessity, a *semantic* source code formatter. In general it tries to make
smart formatting decisions based on the meaning of arguments in an otherwise
unstructured list of arguments in a cmake statement. `cmake-format` can
intelligently format your custom commands, but you will need to tell it how
to interpret your arguments.

Currently, you can do this by adding your command specifications to the
`additional_commands` configuration variables, e.g.:

.. code::

    # Additional FLAGS and KWARGS for custom commands
    additional_commands = {
      "foo": {
        "pargs": 2,
        "flags": ["BAR", "BAZ"],
        "kwargs": {
          "HEADERS": '*',
          "SOURCES": '*',
          "DEPENDS": '*',
        }
      }
    }

The format is a nested dictionary mapping statement names (dictionary keys)
to argument specifications. The argument specification is composed of three
fields:

* ``pargs``: an integer indicating the number of positional arguments expected,
  or one of the sentinel strings ``?`` (zero or one), ``*`` (zero or more),
  ``+`` (one or more).
* ``flags``: a list of flag arguments: sentinel strings which are parsed as
  positional arguments but have special meaning. In particular, if one of these
  strings is encountered after a ``kwarg`` it will not be associated with the
  ``kwarg`` but with the statement.
* ``kwargs``: a dictionary mapping keywords to sub-specifications. A
  sub-specification may be a complete dictionary of ``pargs``, ``flags``, and
  ``kwargs`` (nested, all the way down). Or, if the keyword argument accepts
  only positionals, then it can be simply the ``pargs`` specification (as in
  the example above).

For the example specification above, the custom command would look something
like this:

.. code::

   foo(hello world
       HEADERS a.h b.h c.h d.h
       SOURCES a.cc b.cc c.cc d.cc
       DEPENDS flub buzz bizz
       BAR BAZ)
